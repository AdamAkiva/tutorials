## Module mock example

This project contains a mock example which uses module mocking in ES6 to mock
an external authentication service.  
Another implementation option is to supply the authentication function as a
callback instead of mocking the entire module (Basically DI), an option which
I prefer.  
However, sometimes you have to use module mocking, and hopefully this example
will help you to implement it
